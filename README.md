## CSV processor

### Application overview

![Application screen](https://github.com/movaclub/js-cvs/blob/master/screenshot.png)

To start using the application one has to pick a CSV file (_no headers please_); as soon as the CSV file touches the form, it gets parsed and processed: left-hand side reflects the source file content, while on the right, there's a processed, i.e. having zero's interpolated variant of the matrix.
